# England Tour of India - Test Series, 2021

<h3> About The Project </h3>

I have always wanted to combine my two interests of Sports and Data. As a result, when England were going to tour India for 4 Tests, I decided to use my time wisely and made staying up all night to watch the match slightly productive. I collected the raw ball-to-ball data for each test and decided to perform some analysis on it using Python and Machine Learning Tools. This project contains two folders:

* The first folder contains raw ball-to-ball data for each test match including each inning, each day and the teams tab.
* The second folder contains the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks in which I used Python and performed some basic analysis like generating the batting stats, bowling stats, extras, fall of wickets, and partnerships from the above data.

Feel free to fork the repo to work on it. Also, it would be great if anyone could suggest other useful analysis I could do using this data (Twitter Handle: <a href = "https://twitter.com/MahipShah007"> MahipShah007 </a>). Hope you have fun!
